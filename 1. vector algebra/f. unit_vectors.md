# Unit Vectors

**Unit vectors** are vectors whose magnitude is exactly 1 unit. If we divide each component of a vector **v** by ‖v‖, we get the unit vector **û** in the same direction as **v**:

û = v / ‖v‖

## Standard Unit Vectors

In a Cartesian coordinate system, the standard unit vectors point along the positive directions of the axes. In three dimensions:

- **î** = (1, 0, 0) — along the x-axis
- **ĵ** = (0, 1, 0) — along the y-axis
- **k̂** = (0, 0, 1) — along the z-axis

## Unit Circle

Any point on the unit circle (a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin) represents a unit vector in two dimensions.
