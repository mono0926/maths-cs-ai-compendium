# Linear Dependence

A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if at least one vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others (scaling and adding). This means there exists a non-trivial solution (not all coefficients are zero) to:

c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + ... + cₙvₙ = **0**

where v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ are the vectors and c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ are scalar coefficients.

## Properties

1. Two vectors that are **parallel or collinear** (point in the same or opposite direction) are linearly dependent.
2. Any set of vectors that contains the **zero vector** is linearly dependent.
3. If a set of vectors in 2D lies on the same line, or in 3D lies on the same plane, they are linearly dependent.
4. The standard basis vectors in R² (**i** = (1, 0) and **j** = (0, 1)) are linearly **independent**.
5. Any set of non-zero, **mutually orthogonal** vectors is linearly independent.
