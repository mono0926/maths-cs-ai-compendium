# Linear Transformations

A **linear transformation** (or linear map) is a mapping V to W between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Matrix multiplication (A x B) can be viewed as applying linear transformation B to matrix A.

A **degenerate transformation** compresses a matrix into a line.
