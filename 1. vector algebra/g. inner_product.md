# Inner Product

An **inner product** on a vector space V is a function that takes two vectors from V and produces a scalar, usually denoted as ⟨u, v⟩. It is a generalisation of the dot product.

## Properties

1. **Positive Definiteness:** ⟨v, v⟩ ≥ 0 for all v in V, and ⟨v, v⟩ = 0 if and only if v = **0**.
2. **Conjugate Symmetry:** ⟨u, v⟩ = conjugate of ⟨v, u⟩. For real vector spaces, this simplifies to ⟨u, v⟩ = ⟨v, u⟩.
3. **Linearity in the First Argument:** ⟨au + bv, w⟩ = a⟨u, w⟩ + b⟨v, w⟩ for all u, v, w in V and all scalars a, b.
