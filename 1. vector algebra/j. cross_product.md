# Cross Product

The **cross product** (or vector product) is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It results in a third vector that is **perpendicular** to both of the original vectors.

## Definition

Given two vectors **a** = (a₁, a₂, a₃) and **b** = (b₁, b₂, b₃), their cross product **c** = **a** × **b** is:

c = (a₂b₃ - a₃b₂)**î** + (a₃b₁ - a₁b₃)**ĵ** + (a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)**k̂**

Alternatively, using magnitudes and the sine of the angle between them:

‖a × b‖ = ‖a‖ ‖b‖ sin(θ)

## Properties

1. **Perpendicularity:** The resulting vector is orthogonal to both original vectors.
2. **Magnitude:** The magnitude of the resulting vector equals the area of the parallelogram formed by the two original vectors.
3. **Direction:** Determined by the **right-hand rule** — curl the fingers of your right hand from the first vector towards the second; your thumb points in the direction of the cross product.
